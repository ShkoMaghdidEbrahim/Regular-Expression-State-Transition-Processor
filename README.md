# Regular Expression State Transition Processor

## Overview
This Python script processes a given regular expression and translates it into a series of state transitions. Each character in the regular expression represents a transition from one state to another. The script visualizes these transitions, providing a clear view of how regular expressions can be decomposed into individual state changes.

## Features
- **Regular Expression Parsing**: Takes a regular expression and splits it into individual components for processing.
- **State Transition Creation**: Generates a series of objects representing state transitions for each character in the regular expression.
- **Transition Visualization**: Prints out each state transition in a readable format, showing the progression from one state to the next based on the regular expression.
- **Customizable Regular Expression Input**: Allows users to input various regular expressions for processing.

## Running the Program
To run the Regular Expression State Transition Processor, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Python Environment**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.

2. **Execute the Script**:
   - Run the script using Python: `python <script_name>.py`.
   - The script processes the hardcoded regular expression (`"abc|gkf|md"`) and outputs the corresponding state transitions.

3. **Customization**:
   - Modify the `re` variable in the script to test different regular expressions.

## Example Usage
- The default regular expression in the script is `"abc|gkf|md"`. The script outputs transitions for each character in this expression, showing how the expression is broken down into individual state changes.

## Educational Use
- This script can be used as an educational tool to understand how regular expressions are interpreted in terms of state machines, making it useful for those learning about regular expressions, parsers, or compilers.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome to enhance this script, such as adding support for more complex regular expressions, optimizing the state transition logic, or improving the output format.
